# Multivariate-Linear-Regression
Multivariate Linear Regression Models on USA Housing
Python libraries used include Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib


In this lab we work through the process of:
1. implementing a linear regression model
2. defining, implementing and testing multiple loss functions 
3. minimizing loss functions using gradient descent
4. comparing with python library functions
5. Using the model to predict on test data
